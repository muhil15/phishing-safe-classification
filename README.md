# 📧 Email Phishing Detection (R Project)

This project builds a machine learning system to classify emails as phishing or legitimate using R.
Five models were trained — Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost — to identify malicious emails based on textual features like number of words, links, domains, and stopwords.
After evaluation, XGBoost achieved the highest performance (AUC ≈ 0.90) and provides the most reliable detection of phishing emails.
